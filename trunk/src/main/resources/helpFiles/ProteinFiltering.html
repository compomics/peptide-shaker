        <H2>Protein Filtering</H2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The protein filtering dialog makes it straightforward to filter the protein 
            table in the Overview tab, e.g., to find a protein with a given protein 
            accession number, or to find all proteins with more than a certain number of 
            spectra.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Filtering</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            When editing one of the filtering fields the protein table is 
            automatically updated. When the wanted protein(s) have been located close 
            the dialog by clicking the Exit button.
        </p>

        <h3>Case Sensitivity</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Note that the Accession and Description fields are <i>case sensitive</i>, i.e., 
            searching for 'Albumin' and 'albumin' is not the same thing. 
            <br><br>
            Also note that both fields support regular expression search. For more details on regular 
            expressions in Java see <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex">Java Regular Expressions</a>.
