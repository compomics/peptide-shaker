        <H2>Peptide to Protein Structure Mapping</H2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> tries to map the detected peptides for a given protein onto the <a href="http://www.pdb.org">PDB structure</a> of 
            the protein using <a href="http://www.jmol.org">Jmol</a>. If multiple PDB structures exist for a protein, it is up to the user to select 
            the desired structure. If there are more than one chain in the structure, the user also decides which of the chains to use.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h3>Incomplete Mapping</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Note that the amino acid sequence covered by the PDB structure is (almost) always shorter than the complete protein 
            sequence. The overlap and the sequence coverage obtained is shown for each chain in the <i>PDB Chains</i> table.
            <br><br>
            Due to the often limited coverage provided by the PDB structure, not all peptides can be mapped to the structure. The 
            peptides that can be mapped are annotated with <i>PDB</i> in the <i>Peptides</i> table to the lower left and shown in 
            green on the 3D structure model. The currently selected peptide is shown in blue.
        </p>

        <h3>Rotating and Simple Interaction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            By default the structure rotates slowly around the structure's y-axis. The feature can be turned on or off 
            from the menu in the upper right corner of the structure panel.
            <br><br>
            On the same menu there are also options for choosing between two different structure model types, and an 
            option for turning on/off the modification labels.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h3>Manual Interaction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            To manually rotate the structure simply left click it and drag it in the wanted direction. Zooming is achieved 
            either by holding down middle mouse key and dragging up or down, or by the use of the scroll wheel. Moving 
            the structure is done by double clicking and dragging the left mouse button.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h3>Advanced Interaction</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Additional interaction with the structure is achieved by right clicking in the structure panel. For further 
            details on how to modify the structure see <a href="http://www.jmol.org">Jmol</a>. Jmol is an open-source 
            Java viewer for chemical structures, here used to display protein structures.
