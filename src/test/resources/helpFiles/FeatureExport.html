            This dialog makes it straightforward to export data from <b>PeptideShaker</b> to tab separated text files 
            at six levels: 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Proteins</li>
            <li>Peptides</li>
            <li>PSMs</li>
            <li>Search Engines</li>
            <li>Fractions</li>
            <li>Complete Project</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="justify">
            For the first five you can decide with features you want to export. 
            <br><br>
            Note that you can only export 
            features for one level at the time, i.e., proteins <b>or</b> peptides, not proteins <b>and</b> peptides. However, 
            some of the export options includes information from more than one level.
            <br><br>
            The export Project option is an advanced export and recommended for expert use only. In most cases 
            you should be able to obtain the wanted export via the other export options.
            <br><br>
            <i>Note that you can also export the content of most tables and all plots via the contextual export options 
                available in the upper right corner of each table/plot.</i>
