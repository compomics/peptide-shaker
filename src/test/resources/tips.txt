Which database are you using?<br><br>Using large databases increases the amount of false positive identifications.<br><br>Use only the species expected in the sample.<br><br>We recommend the use of reviewed <a href="http://uniprot.org">UniProt</a> databases.
<b>PeptideShaker</b> not finding your protein?<br><br>Verify that you are using the correct database and that no error occurred during the import of the FASTA file! <br><br><a href="http://compomics.github.io/searchgui/wiki/databasehelp.html">More help on databases</a>.
Did you expect more peptides/proteins?<br><br>Verify the search engine performance(s) in the <i>Spectrum IDs</i> tab. Adjust the validation settings in the <i>Validation</i> tab.<br><br><i>If comparing results with other packages, remember to use the same search, import and validation settings!</i>
Using Mascot?<br><br>Make sure that the database used is identical to the one provided to <b>PeptideShaker</b>.<br><br>And that the Mascot <i>decoy</i> option is <b><u>not</u></b> selected!
Did you check the QC plots?<br><br>Quality Control plots are available in the <i>QC Plots</i> tab.<br><br>That way you can verify that everything went OK during the identification process.
Need another QC metric/plot?<br><br>Propose it on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>!

X's in your database?<br><br>X's in protein sequences make it difficult for <b>PeptideShaker</b> to interpret your results. Peptides with more than 75% X's will be ignored.
Unexpected peptide-protein mapping?<br><br><b>PeptideShaker</b> remaps every peptide to your sequence database. The peptide to protein mapping can be different - and more comprehensive - than the search engines.
Cannot find your peptide in the protein sequence using a text editor?<br><br><b>PeptideShaker</b> accounts for indistinguishable amino acids (like I and L) or amino acid groups (like B, J Z or X).
PTM localization scores?<br><br><b>PeptideShaker</b> scores the localization of every PTM using the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.201200408/abstract">D-score</a> and a probabilistic score - either <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16964243">A-score</a> or <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr200611n">PhosphoRS</a>. You can change these settings by editing the <i>Processing Preferences</i> when creating a new project.
Non-confident PTM localization?<br><br>Whenever a PTM is not confidently localized on a peptide it will appear with a white background and will not be displayed in the protein sequence.
Interested in PTM localization?<br><br>Try our protein level PTM export via <i>Identification Features</i> in the <i>Export</i> menu.
Interested in phosphorylation?<br><br>Try our phosphorylation export via <i>Identification Features</i> in the <i>Export</i> menu.
Using large databases?<br><br>When using large databases the import of your files will be slower and the results will contain more false positives. Be sure to calibrate the database to your need.
Need exports for algorithm training or spectral libraries?<br><br>Contact us at our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/peptide-shaker">mailing list</a>!
PeptideShaker runs a lot faster on SSD discs!<br><br>Given that a lot of information is extracted from the mgf and FASTA files it is recommended to store these on an SSD disc!
Terminal modifications on degraded proteins?<br><br><b>PeptideShaker</b> excludes all protein terminal modifications which do not occur at the terminus of a protein sequence or on the second amino acid when the first is a methionine. If you need more flexible modification mapping use modifications at peptide termini.
Doubtful matches?<br><br><b>PeptideShaker</b> flags low confidence validation with a yellow warning icon. Clicking on the icon will provide you all details!
Using <b>PeptideShaker</b> without <b>SearchGUI</b>?<br><br>Don't forget to provide the identification parameters when creating a project!
Running out of disc space?<br><br>An index file is created for every protein database. You can select the folder where to store these indexes and clean it using the <i>Advanced</i> button of the database selection dialog.
When should I update my tool?<br><br>New versions are frequently released for a constant improvement of our tools. You will be notified if the tool can connect the internet. It is advised to always keep your tools up to date.
How do results compare between versions?<br><br>Results cannot be compared between major releases (big number change) but between minor releases (small number change).
