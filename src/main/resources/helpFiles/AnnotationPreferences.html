        <h3>Annotation</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>PeptideShaker</b> automatically annotates the a spectrum with the 
            most likely ions given the spectrum and the peptide sequence identified. 
            This includes the automatic selection of neutral losses. 
            <br><br>
            However, the user can override the default annotation by selecting 
            different ion types in this dialog or in the menu below the spectrum. Note that to change the neutral 
            losses in the menu below the spectrum one first has to uncheck the <i>Adapt</i> option on the <i>Loss</i> menu. 
            <br><br>
            To make sure that the same ion types are used for all spectra, the user 
            can also turn of the automatic annotation completely by unchecking the 
            <i>Automatic Annotation</i> option.
            <br><br>
            The high resolution option optimizes the spectrum annotation for high resolution instruments, 
            by selecting the most accurate peak for annotation if there is more than one option. 
            For low resolution instruments this option should be deselected, resulting in that the 
            most intense peak is annotated if there is more than one option.

        <h3>Annotation Accuracy</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            In addition to deciding which ion types to use when annotating the spectrum, the 
            user can also change the required accuracy of the annotations. This is done using 
            by using the scroll while while holding down the Ctrl key or by changing 
            the <i>Fragment Ion Accuracy</i> value in this dialog. Changing this value will 
            decrease or increase the accuracy required to say that a given peak 
            should be annotated. The maximum value is set to the fragment ion accuracy set 
            in the <i>Search Parameters</i> tab (found on the <i>Edit</i> menu).
            <br><br>
            Scrolling without holding down the Ctrl key 
            (or editing the <i>Annotation Level</i> value in this dialog) 
            lets the user decide how many of the peaks <b>PeptideShaker</b> should try to annotate.
            The level is set relative to the most intense peak, e.g., 80% means that only 
            peaks with an intensity that is at least 80% of the most intense peak are considered. As 
            the value is reduced, more and more of the low intensity peaks will be annotated.

        <h3>Annotation Color</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            The annotation colors plus the width and color of the peaks can also be edited 
            from the <i>Settings</i> menu below the spectrum, choose <i>Settings</i> > <i>Annotation Colors</i>.
