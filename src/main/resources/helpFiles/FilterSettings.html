        <h3>Processing Parameters</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            Additional settings can be set for the preprocessing of the identification files:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>e-value filtering:</b> In order to reduce the memory consumption it is possible to remove identifications with a high e-values. 
                It is adviced to keep these values as high as possible in order to ensure that PSMs reach a PEP of 1. This can be verified in the Validation tab.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Peptide Length:</b> lower and upper limits can be set for the peptide length.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Precursor Accuracy:</b> The higher precursor mass error allowed can be set here in order to filter out outliers.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Exclude Unknown PTMs:</b> When using <a href="http://searchgui.googlecode.com">SearchGUI</a> with a modification at a particular amino-acid 
                on a peptide terminus, X!Tandem will search this modification on every termini and amino acid. If you post-process your results with <b>PeptideShaker</b> using the 
                option <i>Exclude Unknown PTMs</i>, the PSMs presenting inconsistent modifications will be discarded. You can thus artificially obtain the desired 
                results although the modification is <i>a priori<i/> not compatible with X!Tandem.
            </li>
